Phase 8 Preparation: Schema Design & Migration Files

Prepared Phase 8 (Product Manager v2) implementation:
- Designed complete new database schema with 10 new tables
- Created migration files (manual and auto-generated)
- Replaced lib/db/schema.ts with v2 schema
- Backed up old schema to schema-old-backup.ts

New Schema Features:
- products_v2: Added DIGITAL type, soft deletes, weight_grams
- variants: Simplified structure with optional pricing
- categories + tags: Full taxonomy system with join tables
- product_media: Media gallery with variant assignment
- external_links: Ready for Printify integration
- store_products_v2: Added title/description overrides
- store_prices_v2: Simplified pricing structure

Migration Status:
⚠️  Migration files created but NOT yet run
⚠️  Database still has old tables
⚠️  No code changes made yet (to avoid breaking current system)

Next Steps:
1. Run migration: pnpm drizzle-kit push
2. Create server utilities (lib/products.ts, lib/pricing.ts, etc.)
3. Update existing code to use new schema
4. Build Product List and Product Editor UI
5. Update Pricing Overview and Storefront
